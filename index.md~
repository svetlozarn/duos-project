description: Extracting detailed metadata about datasets and methodologies from economic research papers
---

[DUOS Project](http://www.duosproject.org) tackles the problem of
extracting automatically and semi-automatically the relationships
between publications, datasets, and methodologies.  Our primary focus
is on research articles in economics.  From each article we extract
details about specific datasets used, including variables and time
periods as well as methodologies and techniques.
